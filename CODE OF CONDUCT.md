# Psyleo code of conduct

Psyleo meetings are designed to facilitate intellectual exchange and networking. Experiential sessions, or other hedonistic activities are not part of Psyleo meetings and will not be tolerated within the context of Psyleo. Nevertheless, if the intelligent choice of discussion topics is the bread of any successful journal club, then an amicable atmosphere and maybe sometimes cookies can make for the butter.

During Psyleo online forum, a sober, respectful and reflected discussion is expected. Please take into account the variety of backgrounds a group might cover. Thus openness, curiosity and a transdisciplinary approach are values to be pursued in Psyleo meetings.

It should be evident to every participant in Psyleo that, although the choice of discussion topics remains relatively free, the structure of meetings, their content, and the general attitude should serve in in favor of your academic advancement and in support of the Psyleo’s good reputation as a respectable entity within the scientific and professional field, and, last but not least, to advance the consolidation of psychedelic research as a legitimate pursuit.

Group coordinators are required to assure a factual and appropriate discussion within their groups and to exclude anyone unable or unwilling to meet these requirements.

## In summary:

- Observe Psyleo’s ethical rules
- Foster intellectual exchange and community building for the benefit of serious research
- Cultivate a sober, reflected and respectful discussion culture
- Stay open to different views, aim for a transdisciplinary approach
